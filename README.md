_This repository contains the frontend for the "Open Data Visualisation Platform" developed in collaboration with [SINTEF](https://sintef.no). You may find the backend [here](https://github.com/IT2901-SINTEF01/backend). By providing both a dashboard and a Storybook page, users will be able to test different visualisations of their desired datasets. Consult the [releases](https://github.com/IT2901-SINTEF01/frontend/releases) page to get a local, stable copy of the service._

## Overview

You can view the current deployment [here](https://sintef01.netlify.app/) and our deployed storybooks [here](https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=603cc7be306c9a0023f0f937).

The frontend is built with React.js, written in TypeScript. We also utilise the [Storybook.js](https://storybook.js.org/) library to give an **easy to use** and **intuitive** overview of our React components. For deployment we decided to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/IT2901-SINTEF01/frontend/wiki) for more information regarding our architecture and structure.

## Setup

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
yarn
```

## Running

Run the application in development mode with:

```bash
yarn start
```

You can view the project at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Launch your local instance of [Storybook.js](https://storybook.js.org/) with:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Then you can view your storybook at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

## Testing
