_This repository contains the frontend for the "Open Data Visualisation Platform" developed in collaboration with [SINTEF](https://sintef.no). You may find the backend [here](https://github.com/IT2901-SINTEF01/backend). By providing both a dashboard and a Storybook page, users will be able to test different visualisations of their desired datasets. Consult the [releases](https://github.com/IT2901-SINTEF01/frontend/releases) page to get a local, stable copy of the service._

## Overview

The frontend is built with React.js, written in TypeScript. We also utilise the [Storybook.js](https://storybook.js.org/) library to give an **easy to use** and **intuitive** overview of our React components. Refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/IT2901-SINTEF01/frontend/wiki) for more information regarding our choices of architecture and structure.
